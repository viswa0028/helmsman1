AI-powered Kubernetes remediation where multiple AI agents negotiate infrastructure changes while a deterministic safety engine guarantees application availability.
</p>

# 📖 Overview

Modern Kubernetes operations remain largely reactive. Existing autoscalers respond only to CPU or memory thresholds, while engineers manually decide whether infrastructure changes are safe. This often results in over-provisioned clusters, higher cloud costs, and accidental downtime.

**HelmsMan** is an autonomous remediation platform built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that introduces **multi-agent reasoning** for Kubernetes operations.

Instead of allowing a single AI model to directly manipulate infrastructure, HelmsMan coordinates multiple specialized agents that negotiate proposed actions while a deterministic safety engine validates every operation against the live Kubernetes cluster before execution.

The result is an intelligent remediation framework that optimizes infrastructure costs **without compromising reliability or application availability**.

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Managing Kubernetes clusters requires continuous monitoring and operational expertise.

Platform engineers frequently ask questions like:

- Which deployment should be scaled?
- Can replicas safely be reduced?
- Will scaling violate a PodDisruptionBudget?
- Should a deployment be rolled back?
- Is the cluster healthy enough for remediation?

Current Kubernetes autoscalers react only to infrastructure metrics such as CPU or memory utilization.

They **cannot reason about operational safety**.

As a result, organizations often face:

- 💸 Over-provisioned infrastructure
- ⚠️ Unsafe scaling decisions
- 🧑💻 Continuous manual intervention
- 🚨 Increased operational risk
- 📈 Higher cloud costs

---

# 💡 Our Solution

HelmsMan transforms Kubernetes operations from **reactive monitoring** into **autonomous, policy-aware remediation**.

Instead of reacting solely to metrics, HelmsMan continuously reasons over the **live Kubernetes cluster state** before executing any action.

The remediation workflow consists of:

1. Reading the live Kubernetes cluster
2. Understanding deployments, pods, nodes and disruption budgets
3. Negotiating infrastructure changes using specialized AI agents
4. Validating every proposed action against Kubernetes safety policies
5. Executing only operations that preserve application availability

Unlike traditional AI systems, **HelmsMan never trusts LLM output alone**.

Every infrastructure change is validated against the **real Kubernetes API** before execution.

---

# 🔄 Multi-Agent Workflow

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/architecture-flow.png" alt="Workflow" width="950">
</p>

HelmsMan orchestrates two specialized AI agents that collaboratively determine the safest remediation strategy.

## 💰 FinOps Agent

The FinOps Agent focuses on **cost optimization**.

Responsibilities include:

- Detecting idle workloads
- Identifying over-provisioned deployments
- Recommending replica reductions
- Improving infrastructure utilization
- Reducing cloud costs

---

## 🛡️ Availability Guardian

The Availability Guardian protects application reliability.

Responsibilities include:

- Evaluating deployment health
- Inspecting PodDisruptionBudgets
- Preventing unsafe scale-down operations
- Validating availability constraints
- Reviewing every remediation proposal

---

## 🔐 Safety Engine

The Safety Engine serves as the final authority.

Before executing any infrastructure action, it validates:

- Deployment status
- Replica count
- PodDisruptionBudget requirements
- Minimum available replicas
- Cluster health

If any Kubernetes availability policy would be violated, the operation is rejected before reaching the Kubernetes API.

---

# 🏗️ System Architecture

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/architecture.png" alt="Architecture" width="1000">
</p>

The architecture combines AI reasoning with deterministic policy enforcement.

Rather than allowing AI agents to directly manipulate Kubernetes resources, every remediation request passes through the MCP server where infrastructure policies are validated before execution.

This separation guarantees that safety remains deterministic regardless of AI output.

---

# 📊 Dashboard

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dashboard.jpeg" alt="Dashboard" width="1000">
</p>

The HelmsMan dashboard provides real-time visibility into:

- Cluster topology
- Deployment health
- Pod readiness
- Infrastructure metrics
- AI agent decisions
- Approved actions
- Rejected actions
- Audit history

Operators can inspect the complete remediation lifecycle while maintaining full transparency over every infrastructure decision.

# 🎬 Demo Walkthrough

## Step 1 — Start the Cluster

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Verify that the cluster is healthy.

---

## Step 2 — Deploy the Sample Application

Deploy an intentionally over-provisioned workload.

```text
Deployment: checkout-service

Replicas: 5
```

---

## Step 3 — FinOps Agent Suggests Optimization

The FinOps Agent recommends:

```text
Scale checkout-service

5 replicas

↓

1 replica
```

---

## Step 4 — Availability Guardian Review

The Availability Guardian evaluates:

- Deployment health
- Current replicas
- PodDisruptionBudget
- Minimum available pods

---

## Step 5 — Safety Validation

Before execution, the Safety Engine validates the request using the live Kubernetes API.

Example response:

```json
{
  "approved": false,
  "reason": "Scaling would violate PodDisruptionBudget"
}
```

Unsafe operations are rejected immediately.

---

## Step 6 — View the Audit Trail

Run the following prompt:

```text
change_record
```

The audit includes:

- Requested operation
- Approval status
- Timestamp
- Validation checks
- Rejection reason

---

## Step 7 — Verify Cluster State

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The deployment remains healthy and no pods are terminated because the Safety Engine blocked the unsafe action.

---

# 📈 Observability

HelmsMan continuously reasons over:

- Deployments
- ReplicaSets
- Pods
- Nodes
- Services
- PodDisruptionBudgets
- Cluster topology
- kube-state-metrics
- Previous remediation history

This enables AI agents to make informed decisions using the **live state** of the Kubernetes cluster instead of relying solely on static resource metrics.

---

# 🌟 Why HelmsMan?

Modern Kubernetes platforms provide excellent orchestration capabilities, but operational decisions still require human intervention or rely on simple metric-based autoscaling.

HelmsMan introduces a new paradigm: **policy-aware autonomous remediation**, where AI agents collaborate to optimize infrastructure while a deterministic safety engine guarantees that Kubernetes availability policies are never violated.

---

## 📊 Comparison

| Traditional Kubernetes Operations | ⚓ HelmsMan |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| CPU / Memory Threshold Autoscaling | Multi-Agent AI Decision Making |
| Reactive Monitoring | Autonomous Remediation |
| Manual Infrastructure Decisions | Intelligent Cost Optimization |
| No Operational Reasoning | Live Cluster State Reasoning |
| Safety Depends on Operators | Deterministic Safety Engine |
| No Agent Collaboration | Multi-Agent Negotiation |
| Limited Auditability | Complete Audit Trail |
| Metrics-Only Decisions | Metrics + Kubernetes Policies |

---

# 🛡️ Safety by Design

HelmsMan follows a **"Trust, but Verify"** philosophy.

AI agents can propose infrastructure changes, but **they never communicate directly with Kubernetes**.

Every action is routed through the MCP server where the Safety Engine validates:

- Deployment status
- Replica count
- PodDisruptionBudget constraints
- Minimum available replicas
- Cluster health
- Kubernetes API responses

Only validated operations are executed.

This architecture ensures that **availability is enforced programmatically instead of relying solely on AI reasoning**.

---

# 🔐 Safety Guarantees

Every remediation request undergoes:

- ✅ Live Kubernetes API validation
- ✅ PodDisruptionBudget enforcement
- ✅ Replica safety verification
- ✅ Deployment health checks
- ✅ Complete audit logging

If any policy would be violated, the operation is automatically rejected before reaching Kubernetes.
